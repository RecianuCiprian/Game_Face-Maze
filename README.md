## Synopsis

It's a game that allows a user to play Pac-Man. 
The user is featured based on his profile image available within a social site (e.g., Facebook, GitHub, Gravatar, Last.fm etc.).
The "ghosts" are shown as images (avatars) from the user friends list on his social site.
If the player has reached a ghost, then the application will automatically generate a message that will appear in a microblogging service like Twitter such as "Playing #FaceMaze, I swallowed #user".
